### A Fullstack Event Booking Platform Solution

If you want to build sites like Attendance Tackers, or similar Event Booking Solutions, clone this repo and tweak it to your needs.

### Cloning and Running

The frontend is in the client folder of the root directory.

In the root directory, run scripts 'server' and 'client' for the development of backend and frontend respectively.

### Features

#### Authentication
Using json webtokens with every request and expiration time default is 1 hour.

#### Database
Mongodb. Free account on Monodb Atlas.

#### Batch Requests
Using Facebook's Data Loader library. Do check the difference in performance with and without the data loader.

### Pending Implementations

I just made a MVP. I have many things on my mind which I would like to implement.

1. Authentication Token Persistence
2. Refresh Tokens
3. Local storage in browsers to reduce requests
4. Refactoring all the CSS.
5. Animations
6. Form Validation after Server Response
7. Add comments and suggestions throughout the codebase
